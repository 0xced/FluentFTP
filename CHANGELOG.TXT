Renamed FtpTransferMode enum to FtpDataType
Renamed FtpDataMode to FtpDataChannelType
Renamed DefaultDataMode property of FtpCommandChannel to DataChannelType
Renamed SetTransferMode() of FtpCommandChannel method to SetDataType()
Added new FtpDataMode enum for Stream and Block transfers
Added new FtpDataStructure enum, currently only File type structures are
  supported. If this makes no sense read RFC959 3.1.2. Data Structures.
Added new SetDataMode() method FtpCommandChannel for specifying
  stream or block transfer modes.
Removed pipelining support from Open*DataChannel() methods to reduce
  complication of code. Little value was added by pipelining just a
  couple of commands and thus doesn't justify complication in the code.
Added DataChannelMode property to FtpCommandChannel for setting the default
  data transfer mode, stream or block.
